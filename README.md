### Reviews

What did users think about this app? Here are just a few out of more than 1,800 reviews:

> "Ganz simpel ohne unnÃ¶tiges zeug was ich bei Notiz Apps nicht brauche und das Design ist auch schlicht gehalten. Genau das was ich wollte:))"

> "I must say, this is much more useful than I expected. I try any and all note-taking apps in search of one I'll actually use and I think I've finally found a keeper. The main live tile is nice to use with a transparent background. The lockscreen is the best feature (because of the options that other apps lack)."
